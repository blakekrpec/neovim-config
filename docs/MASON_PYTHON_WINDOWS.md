#### **Mason not finding Python**
Vim is picky about Python on windows. Don't install Python from the windows store, and if you have installed Python from the Windows Store, uninstall it and remove any lingering Python .exes in `C:\<user>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps`. Instead, install Python from [the official Python page](https://www.python.org/downloads/), **making sure to select the option to "Add Python to PATH" during installation.**
