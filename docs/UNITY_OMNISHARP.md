Omnisharp will require a .sln file for a Unity Project. The easiest way to do this is to just Install VSCode or Visual Studio, then in Unity preferences you can set VSCode/VS as the editor. Then a button "Rengenrate Project Files" will appear. Pressing this will regenerate the .sln. After that, the nvim setup in this repo should work with Omnisharp and the Unity Project. You can then disable VSCode/Visual Studio as default editor if you want.

More work in the future should be done to find a way to generate these files without VSCode or Visual Studio.
